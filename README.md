In my Portfolio Website I used (1. Html file), (1. Css file) and (1. JS file).

In javascript I used JQuery and Media Query for functionality and design of the website.

My appoach to the project was to tackle html first, css second, and javascript third. This way I could have all of my content on the page, style and structure the layout in the correct way, and then add the functionality I needed to tie it all together.
